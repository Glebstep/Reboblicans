            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Citizens of the United Federation of Bobrdonia, This election isn’t just about choosing a leader—it’s about choosing a vision. A vision where tradition meets innovation. A vision where every citizen, every beaver, and every lodge thrives together. At the heart of our campaign lies a bold promise: We raise beavers, and we build rockets.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion-button">Our Ideas: Building Bobrdonia’s Bright Future</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>We are not just looking at the rivers and forests of today; we are imagining the skies of tomorrow. Our campaign revolves around innovation, progress, and the belief that Bobrdonia can lead the world in both ecological harmony and technological advancement. Here’s how we’ll make it happen:
                    1. Raising Stronger Beavers: We believe in nurturing our greatest asset—our beavers. Through modern farming techniques, enhanced dam-building training, and sustainable forestry, we’ll ensure that Bobrdonia’s beavers are the strongest, smartest, and most capable in the world.
                    2. Building Rockets for Tomorrow: Why stop at the rivers when we can reach the stars? Bobrdonia’s rocket program is designed to make us a global leader in space exploration. From satellite launches to interstellar dam-building missions, we’re taking Bobrdonia’s ingenuity to new heights—literally.
                    3. Sustainability First: Our policies will ensure that every project, whether it’s building dams or building rockets, is environmentally friendly. We’ll protect our rivers, forests, and beaver habitats while pioneering green technologies that the world will look up to.
                    4. Innovation in Action: We’ll invest in research and development to combine traditional beaver engineering with cutting-edge rocket science. Imagine a future where beavers not only build dams but help construct sustainable infrastructure both on Earth and beyond.</p>

            <button class="accordion-button">Our Good Sides: What Sets Us Apart</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Why should you choose us? Because we’re not just promising change—we’re delivering it. Here’s what makes us the right choice for Bobrdonia:
                    * Visionary Leadership: We think BIG. While others are stuck chewing on old ideas, we’re planning the future of our forests, rivers, and skies.
                    * Action-Oriented: Promises are meaningless without action. We’ve already started developing sustainable beaver farming techniques and our first prototypes of eco-friendly rockets.
                    * Unity and Growth: Our policies aim to unite all citizens of Bobrdonia—both people and beavers. Together, we’ll create jobs, grow our economy, and solidify our place as a global leader.
                    * Pride in Bobrdonia: Everything we do is for the love of our country. From the dams to the stars, we want every Bobrdonian to be proud of what we’re building together.</p>

            <button class="accordion-button">Our Main Idea: “From Rivers to Rockets”</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Our campaign is built on a simple but powerful idea: “From Rivers to Rockets.” We respect the traditions of Bobrdonia, and we honor the contributions of every hardworking beaver. But we also know that the future is waiting for us among the stars. With your support, we’ll turn this dream into reality.</p>
